# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-Feature-Engineering-Model
Built a Titanic survival prediction model using passenger demographics and ticket data; performed preprocessing, EDA, and feature engineering (age, class, fare, family size, embarkation) and evaluated multiple classifiers (logistic regression, decision trees, random forest/gradient boosting) to identify key drivers of survival.
